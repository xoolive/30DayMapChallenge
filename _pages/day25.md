[<< Day 24](/2021/24)

A (minimal effort) follow up on yesterday's map with the same colors. Now the glitches are apparent on the map.

Interactivity comes with the selection of the year.

Also I chose to keep the same choice of colors but they probably don't work so well on all maps with neighbouring countries showing similar colors. I guess it will have to do the job for today though...

<div id="contribution_day25"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    var spec = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xoolive/30DayMapChallenge/master/contributions/challenge_day25.json";
    var opt = {"renderer": "canvas", "actions": true};
    vegaEmbed("#contribution_day25", spec, opt).then(function(result) { }).catch(console.error);
</script>
