As stated in my [original tweet](https://twitter.com/x00live/status/1455485264181202944?s=20) on November 2nd, I didn't plan to participate in this challenge but ended up jumping in (a bit) late, thinking I would do only the fun ones if I have the time.

I hadn’t anticipated it would be fun in that way. Fun to browse through the #30DayMapChallenge hashtag, to find people running similar ideas with different tools or data sources, people introducing new stuff they are passionate about.

I hadn’t imagine it would be so mind challenging to think about what kind of map I should prepare, sometimes few days in advance because of other life constraints.

As I develop a Python mapping library [cartes](https://github.com/xoolive/cartes) designed to quickly draft fun maps with many projections and a good OpenStreetMap API, I thought this challenge would be a baptism of fire: I ended up fixing many minor bugs on the fly (or writing them down to deal with them later) and thinking new features required for next maps.

Eventually, I found contributions for all topics, one map per day. Some maps are redundant, for sure. I was also not equally inspired by all topics. If I run again in the future, I would probably plan things a bit more (but not too much, improvisation is part of the fun!) and only pick topics where I feel I can bring something meaningful.

Down to the most important: this map challenge is not a competition. We all do it for fun. So today, I would like to reflect on this past month and handpick few of my favourite maps I made this month.

## The most popular map on social networks

[**Day 20 -- Movement**](../20) broke Twitter (compared to my usual impact there). The map has then been shortlisted [here](https://github.com/hn303/30DayMapChallenge-Bot/blob/master/daily/day20_Movement.md) based on the popularity of the [tweet](https://twitter.com/x00live/status/1461967549931872257).

## The map I feel the most proud of

[**Day 24 -- Historical map**](../24) and [**Day 25 -- Interactive map**](../25) could be single contribution. It is still far from perfect:

- the color palette is hard to adjust (from both temporal and spatial perspectives);
- only the [interactive view](../24) can fit the legend;
- a calendar view with intervals would have looked better;
- underlying data needs more polishing;

but I'm really happy I came to this basic rendering with little programming.

## The most time-consuming map

[**Day 5 -- OpenStreetMap**](../11) was not really hard to implement per se, but there was a lot of downloading from OpenStreetMap, faulty requests, quotas to deal with. While the code is simple, it took more than a day to finetune.

## The most fun experience

I tried to find my away around Observable for this [**Day 14 -- Map with a new tool**](https://observablehq.com/@xoolive/disputed-territories) challenge and [@fil](https://observablehq.com/@fil) came to help. I learned a lot here!

## The underrated map

I still think my [**Day 18 -- Water**](../18) is rather cool, but Twitter stats seem to prove the opposite.

Moral of the story: have fun making your maps!

## The source of frustration

[**Day 11 -- 3D**](../11) was not a topic I felt comfortable with, yet I wanted to complete this rendering (without glitches) with Python. I am still new to the world of GeoTIFF files and my expectations did not meet my skills here. After too many hours spent on this project, I just took a screenshot of my best rendering with QGIS. QGIS was a new tool for me by the way.

## The cheapest joke

There are many candidates, and it is hard to do a tie-break between the two latest ones: [**Day 28 -- The Earth is not flat**](../28) and [**Day 29 -- NULL**](../29).
